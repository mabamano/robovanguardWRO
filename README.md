## 🚙 Project Overview

Our robot is a self-driving car that autonomously navigates the WRO competition track using:
- Real-time decision-making
- Multi-sensor fusion (PixyCam, MPU6050, Ultrasonic Sensors)
- Servo-based steering
- PID logic for smooth path following

The robot can detect walls, avoid obstacles, perform accurate 90° turns using gyro correction, and execute parallel parking maneuvers.
